# An ERC-721 (NFT) contract, using Pinata IPFS service.

This project demonstrates the basics of creating an ERC-721 contract using Hardhat and Ethers.js library. 
How to use Pinata IPFS service to publish the NFT image and its metadata, and link that metadata with ERC-721 contract which is deployed on Ropsten testnetwork.
After successfully linking the contract with metadata, the user can import the created NFT into his/her metakask vallet.
